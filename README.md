# Node Cal
####A calendar application for the command line and the browser

##Purpose
This app was built during my time at Nashville Software School with an overall goal of mimicing the cal command line application in UNIX. MVP(minimal viable product) for this project was -
  1. When user runs the application in the command line followed by a month and a year (with range 1753-9999), output correctly spaced calendar for that spefic month and that specific year.
  2. When user runs the application in the command line followed by a year (with range 1753-9999), ouput correctly spaced calendar for the entire year.
  3. When user runs application followed by no month or year, output the calendar for the current month of the current year.
